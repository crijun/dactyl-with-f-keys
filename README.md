This is a build log for my Dactyl keyboard with f keys. Each side should be usable as standalone, therefore left and right side are not connected to each other. Both are connected to a usb hub which is connected to the pc.

The controller is a Arduino pro micro. Fireware configuration and compiling is done in a Linux VM using qmk cli. To flash the hex files Windows program QMK Toolbox is used using the auto-flash feature after bridging the GND and RST on Arduino two times quickly.
